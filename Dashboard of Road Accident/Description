I went on a mission to tidy up a bunch of data and make it look good on a dashboard. The first step was fixing up dates and making them easier to understand by splitting them into months and years. I also played spelling bee champion and fixed some words that were misspelled in the data.

After the data spa treatment, I moved on to the fun part â€“ analyzing. I used pivot tables to create cool charts and graphs that tell a story from the data. It's like turning boring numbers into a visual comic book.

Finally, I put everything together in a dashboard. Imagine it as a superhero headquarters for data. Now, everyone can look at the charts and make sense of the information without getting a headache from staring at endless rows and columns. It's basically turning data chaos into a neat and tidy comic strip. Boom, mission accomplished!
