# Bike-Sale-Dataset
Bike Sales Dataset

In this project, undertook a comprehensive analysis of Bike Sales data, meticulously documenting my progress. This endeavor was not only instructive but also a testament to the analytical skills honed during my academic pursuits at the Tashkent State University of Economics.

Data Cleansing: The initial phase of the project involved the meticulous cleansing of the working data sheet. This process served as a foundation for the entire analysis, ensuring data integrity and precision.

Duplicate Data Removal: To streamline the dataset, I diligently removed any duplicate entries, resulting in a more efficient and concise dataset. This meticulous step eliminated redundancy and enhanced the accuracy of subsequent analyses.

Dataset Augmentation: In order to fortify the dataset's completeness, I addressed missing data points, thereby improving the overall data quality. This process can be likened to ensuring that the tires of a bicycle are properly inflated, ensuring a smooth journey through the analysis.

Pivot Table Utilization: The creation and utilization of pivot tables represented the analytical framework of this project. Much like gears on a well-tuned bicycle, pivot tables provided a structured and efficient means to summarize and interpret the data, allowing for precise control and analysis.

Dashboard Development: The culmination of the project was the creation of a comprehensive dashboard. This dashboard included graphical representations and slicers, serving as the control panel for the data analysis. These visual elements allowed for swift navigation and in-depth data visualization.
